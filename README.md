This is my personal Bash Scripts Final project after Training with JOMACS IT SOLUTIONS INC.

Below is the questions to the project;


Bash Shell Scripting Assignment

Kofi Ezedike is a newcomer to Canada, and he opened his first checking account at RBC. He also applied for a credit card at the same bank where he was approved for a credit limit of $2000. The credit card is ending in XXXXXXX4412 with a CVC of 113 which expires on 05/26.

1. Kofi needs his last four card number and CVC to be able to activate his card and set up a pin. Write a bash shell script to direct Kofi on how to activate his card at an RBC cash machine. For courtesy, don’t forget to welcome Kofi to RBC before giving out the directions. Also, he must be made to know that he needs to insert his card to start. Make sure the pin is entered twice and invisible.

2. Assuming Kofi’s pin is 1957, write a script that directs Kofi on how to use his card for the first CNP transaction at Udemy.com. For a transaction to be successful, he needs to enter his postcode T4E5J1 and CVC correctly after entering his 16-digits card number. If not, the transaction should be declined, and Kofi’s card blocked with an onscreen message advising Kofi of the same.

3. Given Kofi’s approved credit limit, write a script that automatically approves any transaction less than or equal to his credit limit. For all transactions above the credit limit, they should be declined. Let Kofi know whenever a transaction is declined or passed.

Tasks:
a. Show your code/script for each question.
b. Run the script for each and show the results with a screenshot.
